== Uncovery Minecraft Code Repository ==

This project is the complete back-end of a minecraft server with many automations, features, games etc.
The code is as of this moment not ready for installation on a third party server.

ToDo: 

- Documentation
- Inclusion of integrated tools
- modularization / plugin-creation of all optional functionality
- configuration usage instead of hard-coded userlevels/admin names etc
- inclusion of SQL structures in code
- install-script

To understand the code, please start reading the code in either 


index_wp.php (when the code is started from Wordpress)

or 

index_ws.php (when the code is started from Websend/Minecraft)

[the end]
