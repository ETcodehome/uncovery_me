== Uncovery Minecraft Code Repository ==

This project is the complete back-end of a minecraft server with many automations, features, games etc.
It integrates with a Minecraft server, a wordpress website frontend and several backend tools such 
as an IRC server, XMPP notifiations, Teamspeak rights management etc etc.
The code is as of this moment not ready for installation on a third party server.

ToDo: 

- Documentation
- Inclusion of integrated tools
- modularization / plugin-creation of all optional functionality
- configuration usage instead of hard-coded userlevels/admin names etc
- inclusion of SQL structures in code
- install-script

To understand the code, please start reading the code in either 

index_wp.php (when the code is started from Wordpress)

or 

index_ws.php (when the code is started from Websend/Minecraft)

[the end]
